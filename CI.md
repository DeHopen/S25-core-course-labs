# Continuous Integration Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices and enhancements implemented in our GitHub Actions CI workflows.

---

## Workflow Structure

### Separate Workflows

- **Python App CI**:  
  The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci-python.yml` triggers only when changes occur in the `app_python/` folder.
  
- **Node.js App CI**:  
  The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci-js.yml` triggers only when changes occur in the `app_js/` folder.

This separation reduces unnecessary runs and targets tests/builds to the specific application.

---

## Key Steps in the Workflows

1. **Dependencies Installation**  
   - *Python*: Uses `actions/setup-python` and installs packages from `requirements.txt`.
   - *Node.js*: Uses `actions/setup-node` and runs `npm install`.

2. **Linting**  
   - *Python*: Runs `flake8` to ensure code quality.
   - *Node.js*: Uses ESLint via `npx eslint`.

3. **Unit Testing**  
   - *Python*: Executes tests using `python -m unittest discover`.
   - *Node.js*: Runs tests if they are defined (e.g., using Jest).

4. **Docker Integration**  
   - **Setup Buildx**: Ensures multi-platform builds.
   - **Docker Login**: Authenticates to Docker Hub using GitHub secrets.
   - **Build & Push**: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

5. **Security Scans**  
   - **Snyk Integration**: Scans the built Docker images for vulnerabilities using Snyk.

## CI Workflow Enhancements

- **Build Caching**:  
  By copying only specific files and installing dependencies before the source code, Docker caching is effectively leveraged.
  
- **Conditional Triggers**:  
  Workflows run only when changes are detected in the corresponding folder (using the `paths` filter).

- **Status Badge**:  
  A workflow status badge (to be added in the repository README) provides real-time build status.

- **Secret Management**:  
  Sensitive credentials (Docker Hub and Snyk tokens) are managed securely via GitHub secrets.

- **Parallel Jobs**:  
  Separate workflows for each application allow parallel execution, thereby optimizing CI efficiency.

## Conclusion

Implementing these best practices results in a robust, efficient, and secure CI pipeline that:
- Enforces code quality via linting and unit tests.
- Automates Docker image builds and pushes.
- Integrates security vulnerability scanning.
