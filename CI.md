# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

## 1. Triggering Workflows
- We configure separate workflows for Python and Node, each triggered by changes in their respective folders.

## 2. Linting and Tests
- **flake8** for Python style checks.
- **pytest** for Python unit tests.
- For Node, we can use ESLint and a test runner (like Jest or Mocha).

## 3. Docker Integration
- We log in to Docker Hub using GitHub Secrets.
- We build and push an image with a tagged version.

## 4. Vulnerability Scanning
- We use **Snyk** to scan Python dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## 5. Build Cache
- We implement caching for pip dependencies to speed up repeated builds.

## 6. Workflow Badges
- We add badges to our README to show workflow status at a glance.
